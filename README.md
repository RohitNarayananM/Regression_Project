# Comparing Ridge and Lasso Regression

## Project Definition

How Lasso and Ridge Regression behaves on a high dimensional dataset and a
comparison between them.​

Applying and analysing of lasso and ridge regression on a high dimensional
dataset on the basis of existing regression principles.

## Method

We are using two evaluation metrics, MSE & MAE to evaluate our model
performance. Where, mean absolute error (MAE) is a measure of errors between
paired observations expressing the same phenomenon. Mean Squared Error (MSE) or
Mean Squared Deviation (MSD) of an estimator measures the average of the squares
of the errors — that is, the average squared difference between the estimated
values and the actual value.

This shows how good the build regression model was. In the same way to identify
how good the build classification model we are having various EVALUATION
METRICES.
